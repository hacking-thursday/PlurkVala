PlurkVala - A client library for Plurk written in Vala
======================================================

PlurkVala is a client library for Plurk written in Vala.

Implementing in Vala allows the library to be used just like any other C
library. Moreover, it allows for easy bindings to other popular languages
such as C++, C#, Python, Java, etc.

PlurkVala is an event-based client library. All requests on the client
are made asynchronously.

The project homepage for PlurkVala is at https://code.google.com/p/plurkvala/.


About Plurk
-----------

Plurk is a twitter-like microblogging service that is super popular in many
Asian countries. It differs from Twitter in that it offers more engaging
conversations in the form of threaded responses. It also has several other
interesting features such as karma, emoticons, and qualifiers.

You can find out more about Plurk at http://www.plurk.com/faq.


About Vala
----------

Vala is a fairly new language. The Vala compiler compiles .vala code into .c
code and .h headers. It can also build binaries directly from .vala files. The
Vala compiler is updated very frequently. If you are building the library
yourself, you might want to upgrade your valac to the newest version at the
community-maintained Vala PPA (https://launchpad.net/~vala-team/+archive/ppa).
